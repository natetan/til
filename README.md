# Today I learned
## Start date: June 20th, 2017
My plan for this repo is to log something new I learned each day.
This will be valuable, because it is something I can look back on
later in the future. Fortunately, I am also starting this while
interning at *Alaska Airlines* as a **Mobile Developer Intern**, so there
will be a lot of learning.
