# REST

## Representational State Transfer
It is an architectural style that advocates that web apps should use HTTP as it was originally envisioned, meaning that GET, POST, PUT, DELETE 
requests should be used for lookups, creation, mutation, and deletion, respectively. This is also known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 

### Example URLs
`http://myserver.com/api/books/1331`  
`http://myserver.com/api/books?item=1331`
