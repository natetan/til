# SQL vs NOSQL Databases
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) 
whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or 
distributed database. SQL databases are table based databases whereas 
NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs (json), graph 
databases or wide-column stores.  
  
#### TL;DR
SQL stores data in tables and are relational. NOSQL stores them in 
key-value pairs (json)
